# SpectralSNR


SpectralSNR is a python package for applying various methods for computing SNR (Signal-to-Noise-Ratio) on any TOA radiance hyperspectral image data (imaging spectroscopy data). The various methods will return a pandas dataframe with wavelength and SNR. 

## Installation Instructions

The latest release can be installed via pip:

`pip install spectralSNR`
