    TODO

    inputs
        radiative_transfer: MODTRAN OR libRadtran OR pre-built LUT

        method: OE

        SNR : optional else 200...


    
        
    Reduces to 1 row as in Thompson et al. 2024

    Runs required table of libRadtran etc... (can be done in parallel - dependent on RAM)

    Runs OE for the row (can be done in parallel)

    Finish..


    NOTE: 
        - can gather data for a prior for surface to have here... 
        - SNR can be matrix of 200 (Thompson 2024) or perhaps I can have an input for this too.
